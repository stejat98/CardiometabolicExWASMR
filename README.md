# CardiometabolicExWASMR

Code for "Biobank-scale exposome-wide risk factors in cardiometabolic disease: observational, predictive, and causal evidence".

We created the repository to contain the code for the project "Biobank-scale exposome-wide risk factors in cardiometabolic disease: observational, predictive, and causal evidence".

This repository has scripts written in R to perform ExWAS (Exposome-wide Association Study) for prevalent and incident outcomes in the UK Biobank. Additionally, we perform a two sample mendelian randomization (MR) using genetic instruments for exposures in the UKB and testing on FinnGEN.
